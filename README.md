# Risk Forecasting Project â€” Learning From Scratch

This repository is a personal journey into learning how to forecast financial risk using programming and statistical tools.

Starting off from the very basics for me: Python, data wrangling, statistics, and so forth, slowly making my way into volatility modeling.

- Progress has been tracked weekly in [`LEARNING_LOG.md`](./LEARNING_LOG.md)
- The goal is to eventually build a project that can estimate and interpret financial risk.

This is not a finished product but rather a learning archive to which I will keep adding and building over time.
