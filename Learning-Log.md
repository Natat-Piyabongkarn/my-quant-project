# ðŸ“˜ Learning Log

**2025-02-05**  
Finished reading *The Man Who Solved Market*. I donâ€™t understand everything, but the possibilities of math and programming for trading intrigue me. I want to study quantitative finance from scratch; I have no clue what I will build tho.

**2025-02-11**  
Started revisiting Python. Iâ€™ve seen random tutorials before, but I never really practiced them. Decided to go through Kaggleâ€™s Python course and try writing simple scripts myself this time. Around this time, I also started reading *Quantitative Finance For Dummies* to get a basic understanding of the field.

Wrote a few mini projects (like a calculator and a simple number guessing game) just to get more comfortable with Python syntax Still shaky with functions and loops, but better than last week. Of course, I built them while watching tutorials. (Still in tutorial hell)

Discovered pandas while searching for how people handle datasets in finance. At first, I thought I wouldnâ€™t need it, but it turns out most tutorials use it to clean and analyze financial data.

**2025-03-09**  
Started Kaggle's Pandas course. Quite tough but indeed rewarding. Practicing reading CSV files, filtering data, and computing summary statistics. It dawned on me that this is likely going to be the foundation of anything I build from now on. 

**2025-03-22**  
Downloaded real stock data for the first time via Yahoo Finance API and did small bits of data visualization. Just simple closing price plotting, but feels like a positive step. 

**2025-04-01**  
Have been learning about times series data. I never knew that regular Python data structures would be inadequate when it came to datetime indexes and missing values. Pandas simplifies it, but I still need to understand what really takes place under the hood. 

**2025-04-15**  
I took a small break to focus on A-Level revision. I wouldn't want to rush through learning anyway. Realizing that watching a few tutorials isn't going to help unless I actually practice.

**2025-05-28**  
Exams are wrapping up. Getting back into the project. Re-reading some Python basics and reviewing what I did before. Nearly done with *Quantitative Finance For Dummies*. Planning to build something small next, maybe try to play around with linear regression.
